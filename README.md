# Variant Prioritization Benchmark

## Introduction
The history of the development of machine learning systems has long been guided by the datasets and benchmarks available to researchers. This spans classic datasets such as ImageNet, which encouraged tremendous improvement in object recognition tasks, and the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), which played a similar role in natural language processing, as well as scientific data repositories like the Protein Data Bank without which the AlphaFold breakthrough would not have been possible. Recent work has established Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effects (MAVEs) in a similar role for tools dedicated to predicting the effects of protein variants. MAVEs provide an experimental measure of the functional impact of a variant (typically an amino acid substitution) and have become popular due in part to their ability to be freely downloaded and redistributed through efforts such as the ProteinGym. However, functional effects are not necessarily pathogenic effects. One of the most common uses of variant effect prediction tools (AlphaMissense, PrimateAI-3D, EVE, CADD, etc) is to identify pathogenic variants in the context of cancer or rare disease. Here, we release a benchmark that we hope will be used analogously to MAVEs for the medical genetics task of identifying rare disease-causing pathogenic variants in individuals.
